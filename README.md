***InterContinentalBankers*** is a Microsoft SQL Server Database designed as an OLTP system to capture, store, and process transactional workloads. This is a draft version and has no data in its tables yet. So, this is a working in progress, and I will be making updates as its tables got populated and other transactions, take place.
## Content of this Repository:
- InterContinentalBankers.sln: It is a Visual Studio file solution if you want to build the database using this method.
- InterContinentalBankers.dacpac: Another way to create this Database
- InterContinentalBankers.bacpac: When the database was created, there was no data in it.
